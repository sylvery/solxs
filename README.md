# solxs
a simple database to keep track of customers and their printing orders

# future hopes and dreams
it's going to be just another online marketing platform which we've had in PNG

# problems and our solution
The aim of our platform is to address the issues many have been experiencing on all existing marketing platforms across PNG:
1. multiple users posting similar items on multiple market places on Facebook. These so-called "e-entrepreneurs" lose most of their customers because of their failure to follow up on those posts.
2. multiple people posting the same item. this platform will try as much as possible to reduce multiple items being posted by the same person using different accounts but the same wordings. If you've noticed it's been happening a lot on FB market groups lately
3. Payment and delivery. Have you ever tried to meet up with a buyer and/or seller? "Mi sanap lo displa kona ya lo Food Junction ya. Me wearim black cap, red b-mobile shirt na black jeans" then yu go lo hap na yu lukim olgeta bemobile wokman dressup wankain. Who the 'fuck' is your customer? We'll try to reduce that as much as possible.
4. making payments online is nice. the concept is sweet but only the rich get to feel and taste it. We'll be introducing our very own payment gateway of sorts. It will catch on like fire. And that will be a company of its own.
